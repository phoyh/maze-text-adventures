Good old **text adventure** where you
* wander in cardinal directions through a **maze-like grid**,
* push *buttons* to magically move *walls*,
* drink magic potions to increase *stamina*,
* pick up some random sword to upgrade your *punch*,
* and *fight* villains, of course.

There are three games included:
* **A** for [M1ngX1ao](https://github.com/m1ngx1ao)'s game
* **P** for [phoyh](https://github.com/phoyh)'s game
* **U** for [M1ngXU](https://github.com/m1ngxu)'s game

There is also a small game-engine that facilitates the creation of new games.

All the games and the engine programming is in *German* - so be prepared...

You'll need [KidBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic-256) for interpreting the game. You run it with
```
BASIC256 Labyrinth.kbs -r
```
